            Whether you are a tomboy or a girly girl, to have a low-maintenance daily beauty regime,
            sometimes you have to spend a bit of time being that girl. You know, the one that goes to
            the salon for seven hours or spends two hours with her hair extension specialist. Because 
            treatments like these can help you save money and time when getting dressed. Also,
            if you're thinking about getting a makeover or just a little bit of pampering, then heading 
            down to a beauty salon or booking salon services at home is the next thing to do. Beauty salons are
            ideal places for getting a new hairstyle or any other cosmetic change.
            
            However, when it comes to visiting a beauty salon, many people are unsure what procedures they should have done.
            If you're one of those people,you might want to keep reading. Even though different beauty salons give various Services
            to their clients,you will find that many of them provide the same or comparable services. A few of the most popular beauty
            salon treatments are listed below, and you should absolutely take advantage of them.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>Beauty Salon Services</b></h1>
        <p>Beauty salons provide comprehensive services related to skin health, facial aesthetics, foot care, nail manicures,
           and aromatherapy. They also offer meditation, oxygen therapy, mud baths, and many other treatments.</p>

           <h3><b>Manicures & Pedicures</b></h3>
           <img src="Images/2_3_.jpg" alt="salon" width="700" height="500" class="allimg" id="radious" >
           <p>A professional manicure & pedicure will always look after your cuticles. Moisturising foot and hand soak
              at the salon can be a wonderful experience. A foot bath, for example, has soft jets of delightfully perfumed
               warm water. The feet and hands are frequently moisturised with a soothing cream. You can select your favourite
               nail polish colours from a vast range available at the beauty spa, and skilled professionals apply the items expertly.</p>


           <h3>Facial Treatments</h3>
           <img src="Images/pexels-photo-354962.jpeg" alt="salon" width="400" height="500" class="allimg" id="radious" >
           <p>This could include a variety of treatments, such as exfoliation and a variety of masks. Facials & cleanup are necessary
            to maintain healthy, bright, and nourished skin. Because your face is exposed to sunshine, grime, and pollution, it is 
            recommended that you get a facial clean up every other week at the very least. It removes debris, make-up, dirt, excess oil,
             and sweat from your skin. Facials also include hair bleaching, de-tan as well as other facial treatments. Always seek professional
              advice before undergoing any facial procedure to ensure the best results.</p>


            <h3>Hair Care</h3>
            <img src="Images/pexels-photo-3268732.jpeg" alt="salon" width="400" height="500" class="allimg" id="radious" > <img src="Images/pexels-photo-3993449.jpeg" alt="salon" width="400" height="500" class="allimg" id="radious" > 
            <p>Haircare is something that every beauty parlour provides as it is one of the essential beauty services. 
                Haircare is essential not only for our appearance but also for our overall health. When you take proper 
                care of your hair, it appears best while also ensuring the health of your hair and scalp. To keep your hair
                 as healthy as possible, you should visit a respected salon and use high-quality hair care products. Haircare
                  also includes hair cuts, hair colouring, spas, blowout and even hot ironing, simple updos and braiding.</p>


            <h3>Waxing</h3> 
            <p>Another most preferred beauty salon service is waxing. It is the most effective yet temporary method of hair
                 removal that removes the hair at the root. New hairs do not grow back in the waxed area for up to eight weeks.
                  Waxing can be done on almost any body part, including the eyebrows, face, bikini area, legs, arms, back, abdomen,
                 and feet. There are different kinds of wax you can choose from and enjoy smooth, silky skin.</p>


            <h3>Body Massage</h3>     
            <p>Many salons also offer unique treatments for scalp issues or full-body massages. The peaceful, restful sleep you can get
                from an hour of body massage is unparalleled. This is the level of a relaxing massage that can help your body and mind.
                It reduces stress, pain, tension, and muscle soreness and improves circulation, energy, and alertness. If you feel tired or
                lazy, don't forget to book yourself a good relaxing body massage session with at-home services.</p>
                
                
            <h3>Pre-Bridal Grooming</h3>   
            <img src="Images/pexels-photo-730055.jpeg" alt="salon" width="400" height="500" class="allimg" id="radious" > 
            <p>Pre-bridal grooming is all about body cleaning, facials & cleanup, getting extra hair waxed, exfoliating skin, and
                even making sure your nails are glossed to perfection. Salon offers different kinds of pre-bridal packages according
                to your wants and needs. If you're also about to get married, this is for you. Generally, a bride-to-be should begin 
                these sessions at least two months before the wedding.</p>
