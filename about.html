                Massage for the body is a beauty treatment, with various techniques offering benefits to the skin (including the application 
                of beauty products) and increasing mental well-being.[2] Hair removal is offered at some beauty salons through treatments such
                as waxing and threading. Some beauty salons also style hair instead of requiring clients to go to a separate hair salon. Some also 
                offer sun tanning via tanning beds.</li>

                    Another popular beauty treatment specific to the face is known as a facial. The perceived effects of a facial mask treatment
                    include revitalization, healing, or refreshment of the skin. They may yield temporary benefits depending on environmental, 
                    dietary, and other skincare factors. Although customers seek out these services for anti-aging or anti-inflammatory results,
                    there is little to no objective evidence that there are any long-term benefits to the various available facial treatments.

                    cuticles in preparation for the application of nail polish. A pedicure is a treatment for the feet that involves
                    trimming and filing of the toenails in preparation for the application of nail polish, as well as the softening or
                    removal of calluses.
